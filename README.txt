Identincaton of acive moleacules against thrombocytopenia through machine learning

A tool for acive moleacules prediction of thrombocytopenia. 

To use this tool, there are several stepsï¼š

#Step 1 Installation Anaconda Go to "https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/" to download and install Anaconda

#Step 2 Use "Orange3 Installation.txt" to install orange3.

#Step 3 To run Orange Canvas run conda install orange3

#Step 4 Then input the Molecular descriptor data (.csv) from the file :"Molecular descriptor" folder into the running Orange.

Installation requirements: We are based on Python 3.10 and Orange3.


The contents of the uploaded file are as follows:

Under the Molecular descriptor folder is the molecular descriptor raw data (.csv), which is the training set and test set data from the four platforms of Mold2, mordred, PaDEL and Rdkit respectively, which can be divided into positive and negative samples.

Orange3-example-adon-master is the package required to install the active compound prediction tool for predicting thrombocytopenia.


The Orange3 Installation.txt file is the process and code required to install orange and its widgets.
